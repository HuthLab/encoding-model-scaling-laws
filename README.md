This repository provides feature extraction code, as well as encoding model features and weights from the analyses in the paper “Scaling Laws for Language Encoding Models in fMRI”.

The repository uses a [Box folder](https://utexas.box.com/v/EncodingModelScalingLaws) to host larger data files, including weights, response data, and features.

Please see the tutorial notebook or the boxnote for instructions on how to use the provided data. If you use this repository or any derivatives, please cite our paper:
